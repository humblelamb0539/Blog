                I have always had a passion for technology, in recent years I have taken  great interest in video game development and web-design. Over the years I have seen tons of websites with good, bad, and old design, At the time I thought why basic good web-design isnt a common thing with big companies or medium busineses. That caused me to think about how I would personally go about designing them, being naive, my first guess was just using simple design software such as Canva and making a beautiful website, but later i found that, that was far from the reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                After some research, I discovered that webpages are primarily made up of <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. This sparked a lot of curiosity in me which led to me browsing the internet to try to find the best place to learn aforementioned languages. I wanted to learn how to build websites that are better or on par then the ones that I criticized.

            <h2 class="heading" id="freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</h2>
            <p>
                Intially my first conclusion for my code learning needs was the website and youtube channel freecodecamp.org, It had a lot of tutorials/guides and multi-hour video lectures on its website and youtube channel respectively, It was popular and had seemingly great feedback from the overall community.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I began with the <strong>freeCodecamp.org (New) Web Design Certification Course</strong> which was perfectly suitable for my needs of learning the programming languages that I needed and it offered a certificate, sweet! or so I thought. After I completed my first section in the course which were a bunch of small-simple projects (CSS markers, Basic Survey Form, A Cafe Menu, etc), I had to complete the final project of the section, a more complex survey form which meets all the requirements that the test listed.

                As you can see from the first note that I made in my learning journey that I cheated on my first coding project, which is indeed a shame. I cheated on the project because it was hard remembering all the concepts that the course taught me, I wasnt able to put what I learned into practice but as I later found out, it wasnt comepletly my fault, after talking to some seniors and digging deeper into what the community felt bout freecodecamp.org. I realized a <strong>key point</strong> about the tutorials on the freecodecamp.org website, the entire learning enviorment was boxed into a controlled coding interface where each step was filling in each line of blank code according to instructions and there wasnt really a possibilty of you making mistakes because even if you did make mistakes the interface would give you strong hints which led to you completing that set of instructions without fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is exactly why I decided to stop learning from freecodecamp.org, It taught in a very <strong>hand-holding manner</strong> and the enviorment felt too safe and closed off.

            <h2 class="heading">The Odin Project</h2>
            <p>
                My first note mentions that a senior dev recommended me The Odin Project , which upon further research, looking through its curriculam, and seeing much better feedback about it compared to other courses I came to the conclusion that TOP was a good point for me to build my foudations, it had a do it yourself approach, it provided great guidance and pointed towards plenty of good external sources for me to learn from.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with the <strong>Foundations Course</strong> of TOP, as the name implies it builds the basic understanding of programming and how developers work and dives into Web Development. One of the most fascinating parts of the course is at the beginning, it forces you to change something so fundamental that I couldnt help but feel excited and a tad bit nervous about it.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading"> Linux(ubuntu)VM</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, TOP doesnt teach in/supports Windows, why? because according to TOP its very restrictive and doesnt allow for full control over your OS without severe complications. It offers two ways primarily for you to use Linux if you are a Windows user, either you can set your computer to dual boot with the option of picking which OS to boot into everytime you start up ur computer, or you can use Linux inside a Virtual Machine. It recommends that beginners should use the latter method to use Linux. The concept of virtual machines really excited me, the idea of another computer running inside your computer to its full extent intrigued me a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                After going through the complete process of setting up my VM (<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installations">learn more about it here</a>), I made sure to only study in the VM and not use it for distractions like social media and such. Having a clean fresh computer to work with really motivated me. After all that I was set up to dive deep into TOP's Foundations course and felt really excited.
